[b]Grass and Grass-Neutral[b]

This is another skeuomorphic theme (that is, non-flat and which imitates "real" elements). This time in light colors but at the same time it is easy on the eyes, avoiding this bright white which I personally don't like.
It comes in two variations: Grass, which has warmer tones, and Grass-Neutral, which has totally neutral grey colors for window and widgets, although it keeps green for selected elements, and light brown for disabled ones. Yes, this theme, like [url=https://www.gnome-look.org/p/1517069]Soil[/url], upon which it is based, have a brown tint for disabled elements, which is something I like to use for my themes: making disabled elements' condition more explicitly visible.

It is also made with [url=https://github.com/B00merang-Project/Azurra_framework]Azurra Framework[/url].

For this theme I recommend using non-flat icons. I love [url=https://www.pling.com/p/1625931]Newaita-reborn[/url], [url=https://www.pling.com/p/1169579]Obsidian[/url] or my own [url=https://www.pling.com/p/1012233/]Buuf Nestort[url] theme, which has colorful hand drawn icons.

By the way: this GTK3 theme has absolutely no png or svg assets: everything is CSS magic, including checkboxes and radios.

This themes includes the following elements:
GTK2, GTK3, metacity, openbox, Unity, XFWM4, Cinnamon, Unity, KDE Color scheme, QT5ct color scheme, QtCurve presets. 
(GTK2, metacity, openbox, Unity, Cinammon and QT5ct color schemes were create using Oomox and then modified by me).

The Xfwm4 theme should adapt to any other GTK theme, so it is very useful in itself.

If I had enough time and income, I'd definitely dedicate much more time to this activity of creating themes, which I enjoy very much. Thank you!
