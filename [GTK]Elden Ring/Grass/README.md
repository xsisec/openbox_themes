# Grass Theme

To integrate this theme with Plasma or QT:
- Plasma: import the color scheme (I've added a few: *.colors). I recommend using Oxygen widget (application) style instead of Breeze, or QtCurve.
- Other QT desktops: copy *.conf to ~/.config/qt5ct/colors (to activate it, you need to use qt5ct to manage the aspect of your QT applications).
